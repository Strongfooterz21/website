        <h1>GAME OF THE WEEK</h1>
        <p>The game of the week goes to the game that we feel at CodeDuo is the best game.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We did'nt have any votes for the game of the week, but I picked the game that I thought I played the most and the one I thought was the best.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This week, the award goes to Super Fowlst.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This game has many fun mechanics, the game puts you as a chicken in a world with many creatures tying to kill you, but you need to watch out for demons of many kinds. Use power-ups to your advantage and use the coins you collect to unlock characters.</p>
